<br/>
<p><b>Wayside Installation Painting.</b><br>My time-based installations use material I have collected from the roadside, drainage ditches, land
between buildings, and other marginal places in the local landscape. I depend on experiences in
these places to fuel me in all their concrete specificity: earth, water, stones, rot, worms, mushrooms,
                        new growth, and their human counterpart: cigarette butts, broken glass, cracked cement.</p>

<p>The installation is a set spheres of made of locally collected refuse and natural pigment that is held
together by ice. The full frozen spheres are hung above a canvas and melt over time. As the spheres
melt jagged objects come to the surface, some balance and others fall onto the wet canvas. More
spheres are added over the duration of the show creating and ever growing accumulation of hanging
and wet piled debris. Eventually the water and pigment settle into large pools on the canvas that
    evaporate over time, leaving an inky crust of marks that result in a painting.</p>

<p>The installation exposes all the different stages of transformation in the painting process that viewers
don’t normally see in a gallery. As opposed to my painting practice, the melting of the spheres is a
natural act of painting without an artist’s hand. There is immediacy to these built structures that have
an expiration. A moment in time that holds those leaves, trash and that water before they drop.
There is a smell in the gallery of spring, of wet pavement and roadside material that linger in the air.
The normality of the roadside has been restructured to direct attention and heighten awareness to
what is so commonly overlooked.</p>

<p><b>Terra Plume</b><br>The natural world has always seemed to me extremely complex and impossible to truly
comprehend. Lying on the forest floor, even the simplest forms and structures: a leaf, twig or
mushroom is ripe with mystery. An alchemy is realized as the living world decays and
transforms. The layers of soil below us are in an earthly cosmic dance, one where the whole
    composition is more important than any one functioning individual aspect.</p>
                    
<p>Above ground the same is true for humans, as our cells make up less than half of our
microbiome; the rest is a diverse ecosystem of fungal, bacterial and viral matter. We are our
environment; our skin is a sponge. Every cluster of moss is home to a forest of organisms and
    every fleck of mica holds a galaxy of elements within.</p>
                    
<p>To understand that our experience is one perspective among many is the privilege and perhaps
most profound failing of our human minds. To perceive the world with one lens-- our
anthropocentric one-- flattens its vastness. As an artist, I find myself in awe of the endless
connections, the symbiotic and beneficial partnerships as well as the parasitic relationships,
    that are in constant flux. We are one organism in an impossibly complex web of being.</p>

<p>This series of paintings embraces the duality and ambiguity of the ecosystems that live
underground; the intricate systems whirring with life beneath our feet. Terra means earth,
layers of soil, the home of mushrooms and their hidden networks of mycelium. Plume is a
feather, a column of smoke rising from the ground, or a wisp of spores released when a
mushroom has been disturbed. While painting, I was searching for the tangible colors, forms
and textures of what I can see above ground and letting them hover like an uncanny veil over
    the deep earth and all that lies unknown.</p>

                    <p><b>Fruiting Bodies.</b><br>Foraging for mushrooms while walking through the Blue Ridge Mountains has become a meditative practice for me. It is my way of engaging the senses, of absorbing the rush of rich and subtle colors, forms, scents, textures, and tastes that surround me in the woods. It’s a glimpse into the mystery of mushrooms, the fruiting body of the clandestine mycelium, the thread that binds the life and death of organic matter that often escapes our eyes.</p>
 
<p>My paintings are a reflection of immersion in those environments, an attempt to articulate them in another language, to visualize that which cannot be seen, or described in words. Abstraction of these forms allows me to communicate the complex subtlety of non-linear ecosystems, and the transformative power of encountering them, in all their strangeness, wonder, and awe. When brought to the studio, experimental technique transforms collected fungal forms into unconventional paint texture, while fungal dyes and plant extractions add new elements to my repertoire of art materials. The hunt for colors and new elements found growing--or dying--in the famed red Carolina soils keeps pulling me back to the rugged forest terrain.</p>

    <p><b>Erratics.</b><br>This body of work was informed by my phenomenological research on Glacial Erratics “pieces of rock that have been
transported from their original location by moving ice.” I spent five months at the Burren College of Art, a residency program in
Ireland. I had no idea how drastically the nuances of my experiences, although seemingly banal and placid at times, could produce
                        such a rich influence on my work.</p>
                    <p><i><small>I spend my winter mornings walking over the landscape of the Burren. Large surface rocks, called ‘Glacial Erratics’,
catch my eye. I follow them, like an array of markers, making a course over the limestone pavements, pausing to feel
                        their newfound lichen skins.</small></i></p>
<p><i><small>I stop to consider their presence, and see them as a momentary assortment, lingering here temporarily, after being
carried by the fluxes of past glaciers. Their current inertia, and grey self containment, belie the motion that once brought
    them here.</small></i></p>
<p><i><small>They seem to sit lightly now, as if propped on their own self-made pedestals, while the soft day-to-day mineral erosions
of wind, and interspersing rain play out in the fresh happenings around them. I wonder as to their potential, perhaps as
    a reminder that some things shouldn’t be controlled, understood or neatly organized.</small></i></p>
                    <p>I started painting by questioning what I knew of rocks as being heavy, inert, ancient and lifeless, forgoing their likeness to capture
their essence. Drawing inspiration from the erratics as a perceivable image, I would flip the canvas reversing the orientation to
displace the initial image. In this way, I began to capture the erratics glacial displacement through the ephemeral motion. A sense of
dichotomy was built in the painting, that rocks could be simultaneously stationary yet seemingly fleeting, or indestructible, yet
delicate like a butterfly wing.</p>
                    <p>Weaving through the landscape, I wandered from one erratic to the next. Time felt elastic in the Burren landscape. My paintings
held the same malleable sense of time. I worked on multiple canvases simultaneously and purposely left them open to possibility.
                        These paintings have encouraged me to question my working methods and expose my process.</p>

<br>
<p><b>Waterlogged Series.</b><br>I took a walk in an in-between place with trees and a creek, bordered on all sides by parking lots.
The place reminded me of being in the woods when we were kids. It was late winter or early
spring, the time before any signs of green life. The underbrush was gray. The sky was gray. From
a glance there was no way to tell what was living or dead. Last year’s branches snapped, brittle to 
the touch, as I moved through the brush. A few whipped back, still alive under their gray disguise, 
    exposing new buds.</p>

<p>On close inspection I found objects with other lives, a Styrofoam cup brittle with age, a cigarette
filter once pressed to someone’s lips, cast proof of our existence. These objects are held in
transition as their original use and value disintegrates. This detritus becomes mingled with trees,
fallen branches and leaves from a year past. In-between spaces are a breeding ground for invasive
plants and a few native varieties making a comeback. Wait long enough and you will witness a
    teeming network of animals, birds and insects following daily routines so much like our own.</p>

<p>Looking down by my boots, an ant struggled to bear the weight of an object multiple times its
own size. Unable to get a proper grip it swiveled the pink fleck, round and around in circles,
unsuccessful in its forward movement. I sat with it for almost an hour wondering if it would give
    up, thinking about helping it out but not knowing which way it wanted to go.</p>

<p>Whether consciously or not, the daily struggle is what makes our lives and what we long to forget.

<br>
    <p><b>Second Nature.</b><br>My nose inches from the ground, the texture of chalk in my mouth. Movement that
has been frozen in time, like a rabbit’s reaction to a snapping branch. Water that is
no longer wet to your touch, while the muck from the morning’s walk still clings to
my boots. Primal knowledge, to need, to see, to feel these things before we go.</p>

<p>Visceral experiences like these come to life in my assemblages where highly detailed
images of nature and debris become fragmented landscapes. When making these
assemblages, I am mining my materials for unseen connections to create an
experience with nature that is often unobserved.</p>

<p>Experience becomes space in this highly exacting process. A collage is a layering of
experiences, most of which are felt and not seen in their absence. Images that hold
tense conversations, textures that rub shoulders, the weaving composition that holds
these complexities while also guiding direction. It is a complicated and layered
understanding that is reminiscent of lived experience and wormholes in memory to
recall where we have been and the things we have seen.</p>

        <p><b>Landbetween.</b><br>Beauty itself is the fruit of the creator’s exuberance that grew such a tangle,
and the grotesques and horrors bloom from that same free growth,
that intricate scramble and twine up and down the conditions of time.</p>

<p>-Pilgram at Tinnker Creek, Annie Dillard</p>

<p>I see the beauty of death and decay in my paintings. My work for years has been connected to
death and life. I asked myself how to show that decay as a way to elicit light from a life, to make
life’s immersive and visual experiences more expressive and joyful. A simple way to connect to the current moment.</p>

<p>I don't believe I have to paint gravestones to visualize the preciousness of the moment- life and
death as integral cycles. There is, however, an importance in acknowledging the decay of things
that surround us every day. In an almost inconsequential cycle plants, trash, and cement, whether
naturally occurring or in a man-made flux, in time breakdown. The gravestones break down
faster than some of the trees die and certainly the pavement has resealed before the gravestones
lose their names.</p>

<p>Each painting in the series builds a narrative that departs from the Garden of Eden to make a link 
to nature’s momentary existence that speaks directly to our mortality. I developed an inventory for 
every painting using the narratives of different poems and collected photo-collage of plants, decaying fruit,
and animals that weave through each artwork to tell the story. The practice of arranging material to build a
tangled space happens effortlessly, like the constant churning in material on this earth.</p>
