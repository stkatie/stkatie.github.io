                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>I am inspired by the rich sensations of living and dying life. The crunching of pine needles beneath my feet. Decaying leaves under the muddy surface of a puddle. The lichen that is inseparable from its stone. I believe stories are held in the landscape.</p>
                <p>Whether deep in a cave or hiking over a volcanic mountain, I  gather inspiration from the rich sensations of living or dying life, the crunching of pine nettles under foot or the specific texture of lichen on stone. These perceptions inform my subject matter and working methods in the studio. My paintings reveal themselves as complex layers of paint, experimental processes and collage material that reflect upon the natural world.</p>
